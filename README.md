### Things Learned
By making this Hangman game, I was able to get more familiar with the [fstream](https://cplusplus.com/reference/fstream/) class, which was used when reading a text file for the list of words.<br>
I also learned how to use header files to make a C++ program with multiple files.<br>
Also this game was made in around 2 hours.

## Credits
The list of words are gotten from [Google 10000 English](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english/blob/master/google-10000-english.txt), which was derived from *Google Web Trillion Word Corpus*.
